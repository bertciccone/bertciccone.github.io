Bugs, Bugs, Bugs!

This is a simple game modeled after the classic arcade game Frogger. The object of the game is for you to cross a multiple-lane road to reach home (a "cozy" rock) as many times as you can. Avoid stepping on bugs and try not to fall into the water. Don't forget to grab gems and the magic key along the way!
